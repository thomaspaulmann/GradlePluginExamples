# GradlePluginExamples
This is an Example Android Project which uses all of my Gradle Plugins.

## Documentor
The Project uses [Documentor](http://www.thomaspaulmann.com/Documentor/) to generate Javadocs. 
It's configured to exclude all Tests and the output directory is in the app folder itself ([see here](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/GradlePluginExamples/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L29)).
